        <p align="right-section">My name is Ihsan Hassan, and I’m 20 years old. I’m currently a BSc Computer Science student, and I’m really passionate about coding. I love diving into different programming languages and tackling new challenges—there's always something exciting to learn!

            In my free time, I enjoy reading. I find that books not only expand my knowledge but also inspire my creativity. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, I love getting lost in a good story.
            
            Another big part of my life is football. I love playing the game and being part of a team. It’s a great way to stay active and unwind after studying.
            
            I’m excited about what the future holds as I continue to explore both technology and my personal interests!
